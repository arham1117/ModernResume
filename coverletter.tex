\begin{cvletter}

I am excited to apply for the Risk Advisory Data \& Analytics 2024 Graduate Program at Deloitte. I am currently studying in my third and final year of my Bachelor of Computer Science degree at the University of Adelaide. Undertaking a major in Data Science, I have gained a strong foundation in statistical and machine learning techniques and have acquired proeficiency in Python and R.

Through my coursework and several statistical projects, I have gained practical skills in cleaning, preprocessing and analysing datasets of varying sizes. In addition,  I have gained a comprehensive understanding of data structures, algorithims and programming concepts and have utilised these to implement machine learning models for different data analysis tasks. These experiences have equipped me with the necessary skills to apply statistical and machine learning techniques to real-world problems, and I am positive that I can employ these skills effectively in the Risk Advisory Data \& Analytics program.
  
Outside my study, during my ongoing employment at Woolworths, I have developed strong interpersonal skills and have thrived in a collaborative environment. My experience working in a fast-paced retail environment taught me how to work efficiently under pressure, manage my time effectively and prioritize tasks to meet deadlines. I am responsible for managing customer complaints and resolving issues, which has enabled me to communicate effectively and professionaly with clients in challenging situations. These skills, combined with my passion for data science, make me an ideal candidate for the Risk Advisory Data \& Analytics 2024 Graduate Program. 
  
I am thrilled at the prospect of joining Deloitte, a company known for its exceptional services and expertise in the industry. I am particularly drawn to the Risk Advisory Data \& Analytics program because of my interest in analysing large datasets and the program's emphasis on gathering insights from data analysis to provide value to clients. Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Deloitte's ongoing success.
